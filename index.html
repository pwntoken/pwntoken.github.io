<p>I have already laid down the foundation of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://pwntoken.github.io/web-application-security-testing/">web application security testing</a> in one of my previous post. A web application security program is different than an actual security testing suite and from actual implementation.

<p><u>Note:</u> A Security test plan is different than that of a security program.

<p>Software go through <em>phases of development</em> which is known as the <strong><code>SDLC</code></strong> and represents how a particular task is carried out periodically and efficiently for better code productivity in terms of functionality. A generic overview process of a SDLC is to break tasks into pieces so that they can me managed well and later integrated into a complete working <em>product</em> which can be <em>used</em> for the intended consumers of that product. Similarily Enterprise Web Applications go through <em>application development processess</em> and on each of these phases of the entire process, seperate developers working on an unit is responsible for that particular code and hence is the <em>code maintainer</em>. <code>SDLC</code> isn’t short and static at Enterprise level but get’s worse and complex when phases begin to shift from one stage to another.

<p>All of the aforementioned are packaged into the five super’s i.e. functional project management, technical project management, information security assurances, system integration test plan and integration test cases and user acceptance test plan and acceptance test cases. We are more worried about <strong>Information Security Assurances</strong> and not long far in this way - we’ll be introduced to how <em>information security</em> is governed and where SDLC is outruled by it’s superset, and when precisely *<em>security</em> is to be placed into <code>SDLC</code> thoughfully by it’s governing superset.</p>

		<h2 id="and-the-following-isn’t-discouraging"><a href="#and-the-following-isn’t-discouraging" class="headerlink" title="and the following isn’t discouraging!"></a><em>and the following isn’t discouraging!</em></h2><p>Here’s why software security would always be a growing concern for leading technologies as well as for them who depend on these technologies e.g. corporations, companies, industry, small scale businesses and at a personal level social sites too. What we are talking here isn’t related to a set of standard de-facto technology but what we <strong>are</strong> talking about is the ** <em>economics</em> ** of related web application software, their technologies and how they can be measured in order to provide a continious flow of quality in security.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Almost everytime a new standard, or a technology is released - it <em>does</em> contain <em>vulnerabilities</em>. Most often, these vulnerabilities are either hunted down using platforms such as <em>bug bounty</em> or otherwise dealt with privately via internal security team or traded in terms of a <em>0day</em>. It’s no more about <em>how</em> one was able to compromise the applications in order to gain/trade or protect data but <em>how</em> it could had or has been important to make <em>an impact</em> to the business in concern. Almost all technical security researchers can deal with <em>identifying vulnerabilities</em> and claim they had been protecting the industry - but how about <em>measuring</em> these vulnerabilities in terms of <u><em>monetary impact to the business concerned?</em> </u>  This post is to talk about <em>that corner</em> of web application security industry which hasn’t been much appretiated but still remains the core foundation to providing <strong>real security</strong>.</p>
<img src="http://s14.postimg.org/5u25o02td/solution.jpg" class>

<p>To ** <em>quantify</em> ** the expenditure spent due to  the presence of a vulnerability or a chain of vulnerabilities isn’t an unknown art - but it is percieved to be as the most analytical security research art and therefore requires patience and core understanding about the vulnerability - most importantly <em>business wise in terms of quantifying them in monetary impact</em> and also in terms of <em>technical impact which could lead to furthur compromise or weaken a particular asset</em>. To me there are three categories of businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial scale business</li>
<li>Retail scale business</li>
<li>Personal scale business</li>
</ul>
<p>To each having it’s own valuation in the market and having said that I furthur look at asset classifications for them; which is for an example a stock market would be an industrial scale business and they might have these assets:</p>
<ol>
<li>people</li>
<li>investors</li>
<li>investments</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, taking the same example, it’s self-evident that <em>people</em> lead to <em>processes</em> in their business as per their role; this could be:</p>

		<h2 id="and-the-following-isn’t-discouraging"><a href="#and-the-following-isn’t-discouraging" class="headerlink" title="and the following isn’t discouraging!"></a><em>and the following isn’t discouraging!</em></h2><p>Here’s why software security would always be a growing concern for leading technologies as well as for them who depend on these technologies e.g. corporations, companies, industry, small scale businesses and at a personal level social sites too. What we are talking here isn’t related to a set of standard de-facto technology but what we <strong>are</strong> talking about is the ** <em>economics</em> ** of related web application software, their technologies and how they can be measured in order to provide a continious flow of quality in security.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Almost everytime a new standard, or a technology is released - it <em>does</em> contain <em>vulnerabilities</em>. Most often, these vulnerabilities are either hunted down using platforms such as <em>bug bounty</em> or otherwise dealt with privately via internal security team or traded in terms of a <em>0day</em>. It’s no more about <em>how</em> one was able to compromise the applications in order to gain/trade or protect data but <em>how</em> it could had or has been important to make <em>an impact</em> to the business in concern. Almost all technical security researchers can deal with <em>identifying vulnerabilities</em> and claim they had been protecting the industry - but how about <em>measuring</em> these vulnerabilities in terms of <u><em>monetary impact to the business concerned?</em> </u>  This post is to talk about <em>that corner</em> of web application security industry which hasn’t been much appretiated but still remains the core foundation to providing <strong>real security</strong>.</p>
<img src="http://s14.postimg.org/5u25o02td/solution.jpg" class>

<p>To ** <em>quantify</em> ** the expenditure spent due to  the presence of a vulnerability or a chain of vulnerabilities isn’t an unknown art - but it is percieved to be as the most analytical security research art and therefore requires patience and core understanding about the vulnerability - most importantly <em>business wise in terms of quantifying them in monetary impact</em> and also in terms of <em>technical impact which could lead to furthur compromise or weaken a particular asset</em>. To me there are three categories of businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial scale business</li>
<li>Retail scale business</li>
<li>Personal scale business</li>
</ul>
<p>To each having it’s own valuation in the market and having said that I furthur look at asset classifications for them; which is for an example a stock market would be an industrial scale business and they might have these assets:</p>
<ol>
<li>people</li>
<li>investors</li>
<li>investments</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, taking the same example, it’s self-evident that <em>people</em> lead to <em>processes</em> in their business as per their role; this could be:</p>

<p>##Why migrate to Octopress?</p>
<p>Why would a chap like me want to migrate from Wordpress to Octopress? For that I would first need to answer problems with the basic setup and i.e: PHP/MySQL stack - a complete stupid stack with needs to update plugins/code, etc. in a long run, generate more dynamic pages, parameters, etc in order to exhale more security loopholes.</p>
<p>####Pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>I never wanted to maintain security updates</li>
<li>Being in Security, I know the pain</li>
<li>A nice attempt to keep it clean</li>
<li>Not at all for novice users</li>
<li>Above gives heartache</li>

		<p>Readers,</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I was in a move to port my old blog at pwntoken.wordpress.com to Octopress. I chose octopress over wordpress because of the functionality, the learning experience for the new age hackers and the speed. Along with the added repository at github, I had stood across on this one to be made available to the public from github site publishing service (git pages).</p>
<p>Here’s a couple of pointers I would like to add on this introductory post and what this blog would essentially be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>computer science</li>
<li>information security research</li>
<li>web application security research</li>
<li>network infrastructure security research</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of other posts could make it out here. To get an overall abstract of the posts, it’s recommended to take a note of the category section and then click on the link of your subject interest. The sole purpose of this blog is to serve personal research tracking to myself and keep a regulatory note of information security sciences for analytical study and it’s development in past, present, recent and for future times; however the collected informational repository made out here could be used for essential incorporation of working knowledge into pratical driven measures given original credits are included and outcome of any code herein mentioned or copied does not hold any accountable responsibility to it’s authors.</p>
<p>I hope the readers will find this blog informative and updated from time to time and will ensure a good resource overall for the information security community. I look forward to constant feedbacks, if any. Time to get back to the originals.</p>
<p>Update: Please keep referencing these which might be very useful from time to time ..</p>
